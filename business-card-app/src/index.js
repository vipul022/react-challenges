// Business Card App
// Apply React two way data binding to build a business card:

// Create at least two components 

// Form
// &

// Card

// You can create more components if you like. 

// The values in the card component should update when the form values are changed by the user.


// Donâ€™t get too hung up on the styling, focus on getting the fields to update using data binding correctly.
